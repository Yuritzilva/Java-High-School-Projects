🏦 Simple Banking System in Java (High School Project)
This is a basic console-based banking system I created during high school using Java and Swing's JOptionPane for interaction. It helped me understand the use of arrays, objects, methods, and user input.

✨ Features
Create and store data for 5 bank accounts.

View specific account details by entering the account number.

Withdraw money from an account (with balance validation).

Deposit money into an account (only valid amounts).

📁 Structure
The program uses:

A Cuenta class (not shown here) that likely has fields like numero, titular, and saldo, along with methods like nuevo(), mostrar(), and mostrarP().

An array class containing the main method with a menu-driven interface.

🧠 Concepts Practiced
Object-oriented programming

Arrays of objects
